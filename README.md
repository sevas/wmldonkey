Description
-----------

wmldonkey is a WindowMaker (http://www.windowmaker.info/) dockapp that shows the status of your downloads in the mldonkey (http://mldonkey.sourceforge.net/MLdonkey) P2P application. 

Official sourceforge page : http://wmldonkey.sourceforge.net

I should warn you that this code hasn't been touched since 2005


Installation
------------

Typical ./configure ; make ; make install combo. Don't forget to check for missing headers/libs if he build fails


Notes
-----

Uses the mldonkey GUI network protocol. Works on most GNU/Linux graphical environments, although it might not be really well integrated.
